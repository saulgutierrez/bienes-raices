Real estate website concept <br>
One of my first web design practices. <br>
This is a simple template for a eccomerce website, which includes several sections, like contact forms, about us, blog, and cards that shows all items on sale.
It is semi-adaptative, therefore, looks good in almost each ratio aspect screen, on desktop. <br> However, when you sees this in a mobile, the aspect of the page is not the best, hence is not advisable visit this page from a phone or tablet. <br>
Besides, is important to say, this is only a template, not includes all the backend functionalities that a full-stack eccomerce website presents, because of this, is not possible to send comments or message anywhere. <br>

Technologies used: 
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Normalize.css</li>
<li>CSS</li>
